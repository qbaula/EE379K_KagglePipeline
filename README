Data:
-> data processing code is found in src/data.ipynb
-> train.csv and test.csv are placed inside data/base/
-> once the data processing stage is complete, the modified datasets
   are stored in data/processed/

Models:
-> model training code is found in src/model.ipynb
-> models are trained by accessing the training and testing sets
   found in data/processed
-> predictions are made on the training set and are stored in ensemble/train/
-> predictions are made on the testing set and are stored in ensemble/test/

Ensembling:
-> ensembling code is found in src/ensemble.ipynb
-> the ensembler uses the training data from ensemble/train/
   and the testing data from ensemble/test/
-> predictions are stored in ensemble/results/ in the form of Kaggle submissions
-> a .txt file is also stored with the same name as it's counterpart .csv
   that includes the descriptions of the models used in the ensemble
